# Development Workflow for Sign Language Conversion

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Set up video capture with OpenCV
2. Integrate MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
3. Create basic gesture data collection interface
4. Implement grayscale preprocessing pipeline

## Phase 2: Data Collection & Preparation
1. Record gesture samples for ASL alphabet (A-Z)
2. Collect number gestures (0-9)
3. Gather common word gestures
4. Preprocess and normalize landmark data
5. Split data into training/validation/test sets

## Phase 3: Model Development
1. Design neural network architecture for gesture classification
2. Train initial model on alphabet gestures
3. Evaluate model performance and accuracy
4. Implement confidence thresholding
5. Add support for additional gesture categories

## Phase 4: Real-time Integration
1. Optimize model for real-time inference
2. Implement gesture smoothing and filtering
3. Add text output display
4. Integrate pyttsx3 for speech synthesis
5. Create user interface for interaction

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
1. Test with multiple users and lighting conditions
2. Measure latency and accuracy metrics
3. Implement user feedback mechanisms
4. Add gesture customization features
5. Performance optimization and bug fixes

## Development Commands
- Start development server: `python src/main.py`
- Train model: `python src/ml/train_model.py`
- Test gesture recognition: `python src/vision/test_gestures.py`
- Collect training data: `python src/data/collect_samples.py`
