# Sign Language to Text and Voice Conversion Project

## Project Overview
This project converts sign language gestures into text and then synthesizes speech output. The system uses computer vision, machine learning, and text-to-speech technologies.

## Technical Stack
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing and video capture
- **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow for gesture classification models
- **Text-to-Speech**: pyttsx3 for voice synthesis
- **Data Processing**: NumPy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for ML utilities

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Keep modules focused: separate concerns for video processing, gesture recognition, and speech synthesis
- Use clear naming conventions for gesture classes and functions
- Implement proper error handling for camera access and model loading
- Add logging for debugging gesture recognition accuracy

### Performance Considerations
- Process video frames efficiently to maintain real-time performance
- Use grayscale conversion for faster processing when color isn't needed
- Implement frame skipping if processing can't keep up with video feed
- Cache loaded models to avoid repeated loading

### Data Requirements
- Collect diverse gesture samples for training
- Ensure good lighting conditions in training data
- Include variations in hand positions, angles, and backgrounds
- Label data consistently for supervised learning

### Testing Strategy
- Test with different lighting conditions
- Validate with multiple users and hand sizes
- Measure accuracy and response time metrics
- Test edge cases like partial hand visibility

## Common Gestures to Implement
Start with basic ASL alphabet and common words:
- A-Z alphabet signs
- Numbers 0-9
- Common words: hello, thank you, please, yes, no
- Action words: eat, drink, sleep, work

## Best Practices
- Normalize hand landmarks before feeding to ML models
- Use data augmentation to improve model robustness
- Implement confidence thresholds for gesture recognition
- Provide visual feedback to users during recognition
- Allow for gesture customization and user-specific training
